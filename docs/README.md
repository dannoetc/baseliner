# Baseliner docs

This folder contains the living documentation for the Baseliner monorepo.

## Start here

- **Development setup**: `docs/development/dev-setup.md`
- **Operations / deployment**: `docs/operations/`
- **Troubleshooting**: `docs/operations/troubleshooting.md`
- **Runbook** (high-signal commands): `docs/operations/runbook.md`

## Structure

- `docs/architecture/` — how Baseliner is put together (data model, policy resolution)
- `docs/development/` — local dev, testing, contributing conventions
- `docs/operations/` — deployment, nginx/certbot overlay, runtime knobs
- `docs/reference/` — API, configuration, schemas

## Conventions

- Keep docs short and action-oriented.
- Prefer copy/pasteable commands.
- When adding a feature, update the doc most likely to help future you debug it.
